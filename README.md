# Ruby-Pickaxe
puts "Hello World :)"

## About
I decided to learn Ruby. This repository is my container for the code
that was written while reading [Programming Ruby 4e](https://pragprog.com/book/ruby4/programming-ruby-1-9-2-0). From my
understanding, the authors are respected as experts in the Ruby field and
as such the book is dubbed 'pickaxe' to go along with the mining theme
(ruby, rails, gems, pickaxe - get it?). 

## Disclaimer
This book covers both ruby 1.9 and 2.0, yet most of the code contained herein was written against the 2.0 interpreter.
